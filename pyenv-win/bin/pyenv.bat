'<<<<<<< fix-exec
rem handle 'exec' command.
rem 'exec' is enhanced such that now any program can be launched using it.
rem it ensures that PATH is prefixed so 'current' version of python will
rem be used by the program passed to 'exec', should it use python itself

rem use pyenv.vbs to aid resolving absolute path (as 'bindir') to 'current' version
rem and then prepend it to PATH
for /f %%i in ('%pyenv% version') do call :normalizepath "%~dp0..\versions\%%i" bindir
set "path=%bindir%;%bindir%\Scripts;%path%"

rem pyenv's shim for 'pip' (pip.bat) calls "pyenv exec Scripts/pip"
rem but its shim for 'python' calls 'pyenv exec python'.
rem in the first case we need to deal with the '/' being used,
rem and that because of 'Scripts', we must launch with absolute path
rem whereas in the later case we can launch with only the program name (python)
rem relying on PATH to result in Windows correctly locating it (which
rem is how we can now launch any program using 'pyenv exec')

for /f "tokens=1,2 delims=/" %%i in ("%2") do set "exepath=%%i" & set "exe=%%j"
if [%exe%]==[] (set "exe=%exepath%") else (set "exe=%bindir%\%exepath%\%exe%")

rem 'exe' will be either like "C:\<pyenvhome>\versions\<version>\Scripts\pip"
rem or simply like "python" (or 'dir' when 'pyenv exec dir' called, for ex)

rem copy params to program precisely, preserving double-quotes and percents.
rem this is the main fix for how 'exec' processing in pyenv.vbs did not 
rem correctly handle (get passed) params with percent chars in them

rem 'exe' could be a '.bat' file (or any ext in pathext), in which case
rem it must be launched using 'cmd' to ensure '~dpn' is correct when used
rem within the '.bat' file. also, calling here fixes concurrency problem
